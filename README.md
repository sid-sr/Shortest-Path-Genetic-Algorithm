# Genetic Algorithms:

Optimisation problems solved using genetic algorithms in Python. Genetic algorithms are a search heuristic based on natural evolution and natural selection. Will be updated with visualisation of 
graph problems like TSP/Shortest Path. 

## Algorithms Completed/In Progress:
---
- [x] Shortest Path Simulation
- [ ] Traveling Salesman Problem

## To do:
---
* GUI visualisation tool
* GA for games

## Usage:
---
1. Run ```pip install requirements.txt```
2. Run ```main()``` in the testing.py files with the required hyperparameters.
