# Genetic Algorithms:

Optimisation problems solved using Genetic Algorithms in Python. Will be updated with visualisation of 
graph problems like TSP/Dijsktra. 

## Algorithms Completed/In Progress:
---
- [ ] Shortest Path Simulation
- [ ] Traveling Salesman Problem

## To do:
---
* GUI visualisation tool
* GA for games

## Usage:
---
1. Run ```pip install requirements.txt```
2. Run ```main()``` in the testing.py files with the required hyperparameters.
